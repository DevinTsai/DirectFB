drawable provides a declarative drawing model for directfb the design is based on Elightenments Evas Canvas.


The core design is fairly simple.

At the heart is a DrawableOP responsible for drawing pixels.
For example blits and fillRects.

Next we have the concept of containers two that are supported directly
are drawable which is a tree and drawlist which is a list of DrawablOPS.

These container or composite structures are themselves registered as a DrawawbleOP and responsible for drawing their children ops by walking their internal data structures.
Other container ops such as groups or complex players such as a movie player or dynamic draw list are possible.
