The drawable provides a declarative drawing model for directfb.
The design is based on Elightenments Evas Canvas.


The core design is fairly simple.

At the heart is a DrawableOP responsible for drawing pixels.
For example blits and fillRects.

Next we have the concept of containers.
Two types of containers are supported directly:
- Drawable which is a tree.
- Drawlist which is a list of DrawablOPS.

These containers or composite structures are themselves registered 
as a DrawawbleOP and responsible for drawing their children ops 
by walking their internal data structures.

Other container ops such as groups or complex players 
such as a movie player or dynamic draw list are possible.
